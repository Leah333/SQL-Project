SQL Data Exploration of COVID-19 data from Our World in Data Organization

In this project I create tables using the data cited below and query the tables to answer questions related to COVID-19 such as what percentage of the population in a country has COVID-19, what is the likelihood of one dying from contracting the disease, which countries have the highest death count, what is the comparison between new vaccinations and death count and other relevant questions.
